Use the Azure Functions extension to quickly create, debug, manage, and deploy serverless apps directly from VS Code. Check out the [Azure serverless community library](https://aka.ms/AA4ul9b) to view sample projects.

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions/wiki) for more information about Azure Functions and how to use the advanced features of this extension.**

## Create your first serverless app

1. Select the button to create a new project in the Azure Functions explorer

    ![createNewProject](resources/readme/createFunction.png)

1. Select a new, _empty_ folder to contain your project
1. Select your desired programming language
1. Select "HTTP trigger" for your project's first function
1. Use "HttpTrigger1" as the function name
1. Select "Anonymous" for the authorization level, which enables anyone to call your function endpoint without a key.
    > To learn more about authorization levels, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=csharp#authorization-keys).
1. If the selected folder is not already open, select "Open in current window" to open it

## Run the serverless app locally

This extension integrates with the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) to let you run your project locally before publishing to Azure.

1. To start your project, press F5 or the "play" button

    ![debug](resources/readme/debug.png)

1. If you do not have the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://aka.ms/Dqur4e) installed, you will be automatically prompted to install. Follow the specified instructions, or skip to the "Deploy" step if you would rather deploy without running locally.
    > TIP: The "Terminal" panel should pop up automatically and you know your project is running if you see output
1. Expand your _local project_ in the Azure Functions explorer to copy your function's url

    ![debug2](resources/readme/copyFunctionUrl.png)

1. Navigate to a browser, paste the url, and append `?name=world`
    > TIP: Your url should look like this: `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTrigger1?name=world`
1. A response of "Hello world" is returned in the browser and you know your function worked!
1. Select the "Detach" button to stop your project from running locally

    ![debug3](resources/readme/debug3.png)

## Deploy to Azure

1. Sign in to your Azure Account by clicking "Sign in to Azure..." in the Azure Functions explorer
    >  If you don't already have an Azure Account, click "Create a Free Azure Account"
1. Select the 'plus' button to open the "Create Resource" menu

    ![Create resource](resources/readme/deploy/createResource.png)

1. Choose "Create Function App in Azure..."

    ![Create Function App in Azure](resources/readme/deploy/createFunctionApp.png)

1. Enter a globally unique name for your Function App
1. If multiple versions of your language's runtime are supported (i.e. Node.js 10 and Node.js 12), select your desired version (the latest is recommended)
1. Select a location
1. Wait for your Function App to be created. Progress will be shown in the Activity Log panel

    ![deploy2](resources/readme/deploy/activityLog.png)

1. Once your Function App has been created, reveal the resource in the Resources view.

    ![Finished creating Function App](resources/readme/deploy/createComplete.png)

1. Right click your Function App and select "Deploy to Function App"

    ![Deploy to Function App](resources/readme/deploy/deploy.png)

1. Once deployment is complete, expand your _subscription_ in the Azure Functions explorer to copy your deployed function's url

    ![deploy3](resources/readme/deploy/copyFunctionUrl.png)

1. Navigate to a browser, paste the url, and append `?name=world`
    > TIP: Your url should look like this: `https://<function app name>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?name=world`
1. A response of "Hello world" is returned in the browser and you know your function worked!
