# .NET Template JSON CLI

[![Build Status](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apis/build/status/Azure%20Tools/vscode-azurefunctions-jsoncli?branchName=main)](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/latest?definitionId=13600&branchName=main)

This tool is leveraged by the Functions extension at the root of this repo. It provides a JSON-based way to interact with .NET Templates. It also allows us to use templates directly from a nuget package, rather than forcing the user to install the templates machine-wide.

> NOTE: This tool assumes the user already has the .NET CLI installed on their machine, but that means we have to ship multiple target frameworks with the extension to work with whatever they have installed. One alternative would be to leverage the [.NET Install Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime) to install a specific version of .NET and then the extension would only need to ship that target framework.

## Prerequisites

[.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/)

## Example Usage

### List

```bash
dotnet --templateDir ./../../resources/backupTemplates/dotnet/~3/netcoreapp3.1/ --operation list
```

This will list all templates based on the `templateDir` parameter. The template directory should have an "item.nupkg" for item templates and a "project.nupkg" for project templates. Example output:

```json
[
    {
        "Author": "Microsoft",
        "Classifications": [
            "Azure Function"
        ],
        "DefaultName": "TimerTriggerCSharp",
        "Identity": "Azure.Function.CSharp.TimerTrigger.1.x",
        "GroupIdentity": "Azure.Function.TimerTrigger",
        "Name": "TimerTrigger",
        "ShortName": "Timer",
        "Parameters": [
            {
                "Documentation": "Enter a cron expression of the format '{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of week}' to specify the schedule.",
                "Name": "Schedule",
                "Priority": 0,
                "Type": null,
                "IsName": false,
                "DefaultValue": "0 */5 * * * *",
                "DataType": null,
                "Choices": null
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Create

```bash
dotnet --templateDir ./../../resources/backupTemplates/dotnet/~3/netcoreapp3.1/ --operation create --identity Azure.Function.CSharp.TimerTrigger.1.x --arg:name TimerTriggerCSharp1 --arg:namespace Company.Function --arg:Schedule "0 */5 * * * *"
```

This will create the template with the specified identity. The `templateDir` parameter is the same as used above. The `identity` and `arg` parameters can be retrieved from the result of a list operation, shown above. The `name` and `namespace` args apply to all templates.

## Contributing

In order to work on this tool, make sure to install the [VS Code Debugger for C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp). You must also make sure to open the `JsonCli` folder _and only_ the `JsonCli` folder in VS Code. The source code has been excluded from VS Code when the root of this repo is open so that it doesn't display a bunch of warnings/errors/notifications while working on the extension itself.

### Debug

1. When prompted, make sure to restore NuGet packages
1. From the debug window, select either the 'create function', 'create project', or 'list templates' option based on what you want to test
1. Start debugging!

### Publish

In order to update the dll's shipped with the extension, you need to [run a build](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=13600) with `SignType` set to `Real` and download those bits into the `resources/dotnetJsonCli` folder as appropriate.

With new Secure Supply Chain Analysis, you will need to publish the any new dependencies to the [Azure Artifact feed]
(https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_artifacts/feed/vscode-azurefunctions-jsonclitool).

The easiest way to do this is by `Searching Upstream Sources` through the feed portal. If the package can't be found (private packages), then you can upload the nuget package locally by running the following command from the src folder of this repo:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet nuget push --source "vscode-azurefunctions-jsonclitool" --api-key az "C:\Users\_username_\.nuget\packages\_packagename_\_version_\_packagename_.nupkg"  --interactive
